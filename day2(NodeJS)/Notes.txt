Introduction to web server-

1.)It deals with request and response model.

Client-------------request---------http------------>Server

Server-------------response--------http------------>Client

2.)Web server has IP address and domain name.

3.)Web server delivers the html document, styles,
images etc.

4.)HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) it helps us to distribute
the information over WWW(World Wide Web).

How can we use web server with Node JS ?

-->Node Js has http module and with the help of this module we 
can create server.

-->Node JS is used to create server side and network application.

-->HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

-->after testing all the functionalities to handle the application,
will get the full fledge application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Http server 

// create 3 more routes ?
 
// i)Products ii)Services iii)Contact

------------------------------------------------------------

Task 1-

create synchronous and asynchronous code in single file.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Working of HTTP/1-

when the client sends request to the server, the browser process the
request initially and browser creates a new request to fetch the data
from the server so this is not a good approach because user has to 
wait for long while the browser prases the responses.it also increase
the processing time if processing time of the application will be
increased then the performance will get reduced.

Working of HTTP/2-

it has new feature i.e. push capabilities.

with the help of push capabilities the server can send the asset to 
the browser initially and browser sent back to the client.

HTTP/2 has one more feature i.e. stream headers.

streams are independent , with help of stream headers(bidirectional
sequence of frames) we can exchage data between client and server
within a single TCP connection.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Express JS-

It is the web framework for Node JS.

It is asynchronous in nature.

It is faster as compare to other platforms like ASP and JSP.

Features of Express JS-

1.)Middleware-
It allow us to use middleware to access the request and response
objects.

2.)Routing-
It allows us to define the routes to handle different types of HTTP
methods.

3.)It has inbuilt error handling mechanism.

4.)It is light weight in nature.

------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP Methods-

GET method-

POST method-secure

Task for practice days-20,21,22

try to handle data sent by get request from Angular ?

create Angular project-

create form -- fetch data and recieve that data by get
method using express and print it on the console.

create on frontend folder - angular project (create contact component-
reactive form - create one service - inject that service as a dependency
injection)

create one backend folder - u can install all the dependencies of the
express and fetch data using get method and print it on the console.

Need to use cors(cross origin resource sharing)
