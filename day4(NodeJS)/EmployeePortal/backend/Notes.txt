Call stack-
It is used to track the function call in the execution of
the program.

totally depends on LIFO(Last In First Out)

Event queue-
It is a data structure that hold events and callbacks waiting
to be processed.

Event loop-
Is the process that continuously check the call stack and event 
queue.

The purpose of event loop is to move the events from event queue
to call stack for execution.

Working principle-
Event loop checks the call stack is empty or not?

If call stack is empty then it takes the event from the event queue
and push it into the call stack.
