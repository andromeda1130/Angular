Node JS-
It is developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

Node JS is written in C, C++ & javascript.

It is an open source runtime environment.

Node js refers to the cross platform and highly extensible
programming platform.

The purpose of the Node JS is to execute the javascript 
code outside the web browser.

In Node js we can save files via .js extension.

Node JS has the ability to interpret the javascript code via
V8 engine of google.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Server Side Scripting Language-

It is used to create customised response for client request.

Then the script can generate the response directly or it 
can be connected with the backend server i.e. database to
fetch the information & with the help of that information
it sends and create the responses accordingly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Features of Node JS-

1.) Single threaded-

Node js is based on single threaded concept.

When the node js receives request then it will process the 
first request after that it will move to the second.

Node JS has Event loop that provides the illusion to the 
node js as multi threaded programming language.

2.) Event driven-

In this concept the main loops listen the events and it 
triggers the callback function, so that it doesn't block
the execution.

this concept makes node js more scalable.

3.) It is a Asynchronous programming platform

because it uses the concept of callback and event loops so
that it can provides the illusion that it can handle multiple
request simultaneously.

*All the Api in node js is Asynchronous in nature.

4.) Streams-

Are the objects that is used to read the data from the source
and write the data to the destination.

It also helps us to optimise the processing time.


Advantages of Node JS-

--> it is a single programming platfrom in which we can
write frontend and backend too.

--> it is highly extensible because we can extend it 
according to the demand and requirements.

--> it is fast in processing the application because it
has its own V8 engine.

V8 engine-

It is the javascript engine which is embeded inside the 
browser.

It takes javascript code and execute it while browsing.

Javascript is internally compiled by V8 with JIT.

----------------------------------------------------------------

REPL-

Read Eval Print Loop

It is runtime environment which allows us to enter and execute
the code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronous code & Asynchronous code ?

Synchronous code-

It is also called as blocking code.

It executes as we are writting the code line by line.

eg- 2 Task-

1.) readFile //1st execute

2.) printing Srijan //2nd execute

Asynchronous code-

It is also called as Non blocking code.

In this approach the code will be executed in a different order
in which we have written it.

with the help of callback we can achieve the functionality of
Asynchronous programming.

eg- 2 Task-

1.) readFile

2.) printing Srijan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modules-

1.)Core module-
It has limited functionalities

like-

required('fs')
required('http')

2.)Local module-
We can install module locally in our application.

via npm we can install it.

3.)third party module-
Are the collection of modules.

packages are store under node_modules folder

npm- node package manager

--------------------------------------------------------------

Buffer-

It is a global class that can be accessend without importing
buffer module.

Buffer is a core module.

It is used to store the raw data as like array.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Angular Testing Tools-

1.)Jasmine

It is a testing framework which provides us the application
for the basic test.

2.)Karma

It is the test runner which is used for writting and running
the unit test.

3.)Protractor

It is used for to e2e (end to end testing)
We can run application on real environment and the same application
on Protractor environment,
so that we get the simulated behavior of the application.

4.)Angular testing utilities

It is used to create the test environment for the Angular
application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jasmine-

it is for basic test. It is also used to test Synchronous and
Asynchronous javascript code.

it is open source technology.

it doesn't required DOM.

The syntax is very easy.

Jasmine has matchers(gives us the comparision between
actual value and expected value)-

1.)toBe

2.)not toBe

3.)toEqual

4.)toMatch

the backbone -

1.)suite- It is the building block of Jasmine
framework.
It has one function describe()

2.)spec- It is a test case inside the test suite

Jasmine has 2 global functions-

1.)beforeEach()-
It will be called only once when the spec in the
describe function called.

2.)AfterEach()-
after each spec component get execute then it will
be called.

------------------------------------------------------------

Karma-

It is a test running framework.

It has its own configuration file karma.conf.js
(all the configuration are present inside this file).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Isolated unit test and integrated unit test -

isolated unit test-

eg- service

integrated unit test-

eg- components and directives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Publish package to npm-
